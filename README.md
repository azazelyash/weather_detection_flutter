# weather_detection_app

This is a simple application that was made in flutter using the following packages:

> 1. geolocator
> 2. http

This app uses the feature of <i><b>async</b></i>, this makes the app continue to perform the following task in the background while the rest of the app is being continuously built, this does not stop the rest of the app from pausing its execution.

This application uses the permission feature and takes permission from user for accessing their device's location, also this contains the initState() function using which we can load a function as soon as the application loads into the device.

This module also teaches about try{} catch(e){} function, in which the program tries to compile the block of code in the try fucntion, but if it fails to execute, then it executes the code inside the catch function. This method is useful in uncaught error detection.
```
try{
  // do something that might fail
}
catch (e) {
  // catch an exception that occur
}
```
